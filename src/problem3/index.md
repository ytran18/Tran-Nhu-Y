- This is some issues in the code block
    + Many functions or components are not defined, I guess it must be imported from somewhere.

    + In the getPriority() function, we can handle multiple cases with the same priority. And since its logic doesn't rely on any component state or props, it doesn't need to be defined within the component. Defining it inside the component causes it to be recreated on every render unnecessarily.

    + In the sortedBalances memoization, there's a redundant check if (lhsPriority > -99) which should be if (balancePriority > -99). However, this condition itself seems unnecessary as balances with negative priority are filtered out earlier in the getPriority function.

    + I don't understand the purpose of variables formattedBalances, it's created but doesn't use. So, I will remove it.

    + We don't need to use useMemo, we just use it when our app has a performance issue. If we abuse it, we over-engineer. And now, React is doing it for us.

    + We need to avoid key by index with React and replace it with a unique field.

<!-- This is my refactored version -->
interface WalletBalance {
  currency: string;
  amount: number;
};

interface FormattedWalletBalance {
  currency: string;
  amount: number;
  formatted: string;
};

<!-- Move getPriority outside the component -->
const getPriority = (blockchain: any): number => {
    switch (blockchain) {
        case 'Osmosis':
            return 100;
        case 'Ethereum':
            return 50;
        case 'Arbitrum':
            return 30;
        case 'Zilliqa':
        case 'Neo':
            return 20;
        default:
            return -99;
    };
};

interface Props extends BoxProps {};

const WalletPage: React.FC<Props> = (props: Props) => {
  const { children, ...rest } = props;
  const balances = useWalletBalances();
  const prices = usePrices();

<!-- Combined filtering and sorting logic into a single useMemo callback, avoiding redundant iterations over the balance array. -->
  const sortedBalances = useMemo(() => {
    const filteredBalances = balances.filter(
        (balance: WalletBalance) => getPriority(balance.blockchain) > -99 && balance.amount <= 0
    );

    return filteredBalances.sort(
        (lhs: WalletBalance, rhs: WalletBalance) => getPriority(rhs.blockchain) - getPriority(lhs.blockchain)
    );
  }, [balances, prices]);

    const rows = sortedBalances.map((balance: FormattedWalletBalance, index: number) => {
        const usdValue = prices[balance.currency] * balance.amount;
        return (
            <WalletRow 
                className={classes.row}
                key={index}
                amount={balance.amount}
                usdValue={usdValue}
                formattedAmount={balance.formatted}
            />
        );
    });

    return (
        <div {...rest}>
            {rows}
        </div>
    );
};
